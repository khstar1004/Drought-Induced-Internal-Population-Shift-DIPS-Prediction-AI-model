# ▣Research Background

Climate change is emerging as a significant driver of migration in modern society, particularly as climatic phenomena like droughts pose severe threats to human survival, making migration inevitable for many. While the term "refugee" often brings to mind people crossing national borders, a significant portion of migration occurs within a single country. These individuals are categorized as internally displaced persons (IDPs), who are defined as individuals forced to leave their homes due to disasters, conflict, or other emergencies but remain within their country's borders. This contrasts with refugees, who cross international borders to seek safety in other countries. IDPs often relocate to other regions within the same country in search of safety and livelihoods, and this form of domestic migration is increasing in scale and frequency.

Both rapid natural disasters, such as droughts and floods, and long-term, gradual changes, such as rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns, are major drivers of migration. For example, in the Sahel region bordering the Sahara Desert, prolonged drought has significantly reduced agricultural productivity. Between 1970 and 2020, agricultural yields in parts of Mali, Niger, and Chad dropped by over 40% due to desertification and water scarcity, leaving millions of people vulnerable to food insecurity. Such environmental stressors often force rural populations to migrate temporarily or permanently to urban areas in search of better living conditions.

The impacts of gradual climate change extend beyond agriculture. Shifts in rainfall patterns, combined with rising temperatures, disrupt traditional farming schedules, intensify resource competition, and exacerbate socioeconomic vulnerabilities. These changes do not solely remain climatic issues but also lead to short-term, cyclical migration patterns, especially in developing countries reliant on subsistence farming. The interplay of gradual climate shifts and sudden disasters has rendered migration trends increasingly unpredictable and complex.

Migration induced by climate change goes beyond the simple act of people moving; it also involves various social, economic, and environmental challenges that arise during the resettlement process. Migrants typically aim to relocate to economically stable regions where they can establish new lives. However, in reality, this process is fraught with difficulties. For instance, IDPs in many African countries often struggle to secure stable living conditions in urban centers, where infrastructure is already overburdened. This leads to strained resources, such as water, food, and housing, often resulting in conflicts between migrants and local communities. If such problems intensify, they can create a vicious cyclewhere even local residents of receiving areas are forced to migrate.

This study focuses on addressing these migration challenges, particularly the problems that arise during both the migration and resettlement processes. The primary objective is to propose measures that can prevent issues in regions receiving migrants by predicting migration routes and settlement locations.

# ▣Problem statement

Migration induced by climate change is becoming an increasingly complex and multidimensional issue. Conventional migration studies have traditionally focused on retrospective analyses, which aim to understand the causes and consequences of migration after it has occurred. While valuable for explaining historical migration trends, such approaches are inadequate for predicting and preparing for future migration patterns, particularly in the context of accelerating climate change. Consequently, there is a growing need to transition from retrospective analysis to predictive modeling. This shift emphasizes not only estimating the number of migrants but also forecasting migration routes and final settlement areas—both of which are crucial for effective policy planning and resource allocation.

Migration is influenced by the interplay of social, economic, and environmental factors, making it challenging to predict. For example, climate change impacts agricultural productivity, disrupts economic stability, and alters resource distribution within communities, often creating feedback loops between these factors. To effectively understand and forecast these dynamics, AI-based predictive models capable of processing and analyzing large-scale data are essential. These models can identify patterns and relationships between variables such as drought severity, economic conditions, and migration flows, enabling more accurate predictions of migration patterns.

AI predictive models go beyond simply identifying the number of migrants by providing critical information on resource supplementation for areas expected to experience an increase in migration. This allows policymakers and communities to anticipate and address potential issues such as resource shortages, social conflicts, and infrastructure challenges in settlement areas. For instance, by preparing basic resources like food, water, and medical services in advance, these models can help mitigate conflicts between migrants and local communities while promoting stable resettlement.

This study aims to leverage AI technology to analyze the interplay between climate change and migration, providing actionable solutions for both migrants and settlement areas based on predictive outcomes. By transitioning from retrospective analysis to predictive modeling, this research seeks to develop proactive and data-driven strategies that address the complex challenges posed by climate-induced migration.

This study highlights the intricate relationship between climate change, socioeconomic vulnerabilities, and internal migration patterns. By leveraging **AI-based predictive models**, our research provides a framework for understanding and addressing the multifaceted challenges associated with migration driven by climate shocks, particularly in regions like Somalia and Ethiopia.

### **Key Contributions**

1. **AI-Driven Migration Prediction**
    
    The proposed **Drought-Induced Internal Population Shift (DIPS)** system demonstrates the potential of AI to predict migration routes, settlement areas, and displacement durations. This predictive capability marks a significant shift from retrospective analyses to forward-looking, actionable insights, enabling governments and humanitarian agencies to proactively address migration challenges.
    
2. **Integration of Diverse Data Sources**
    
    By incorporating **climate (SPEI), socioeconomic, and migration data**, the study provides a holistic view of the interplay between climate stress and migration. This integrated approach enhances the accuracy of predictions and allows for a deeper understanding of migration drivers.
    
3. **Actionable Insights for Policy and Planning**
    - **Resource Optimization**: The predictive framework highlights areas likely to experience migration surges, enabling policymakers to allocate resources such as food, water, medical supplies, and shelter efficiently.
    - **Conflict Mitigation**: By forecasting potential hotspots of resource strain, the system helps in minimizing tensions between migrants and host communities.
    - **Proactive Resettlement Planning**: Predicting long-term displacement durations facilitates the development of infrastructure and livelihood programs in settlement areas.
4. **User-Friendly Reporting with LLM Integration**
    
    The integration of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** enhances accessibility by generating comprehensive, decision-ready reports. These reports summarize migration trends, demographic insights, and policy recommendations, offering a practical tool for real-time decision-making.

### **Broader Implications**

The findings of this study emphasize the role of **AI and machine learning** in transforming migration management strategies. As climate change continues to reshape human mobility, predictive systems like DIPS can bridge the gap between data-driven insights and actionable solutions. This study demonstrates how such technologies can move beyond merely predicting migration numbers to offering detailed insights into the "where," "when," and "why" of migration.

### **Future Opportunities**

To further enhance the utility of AI-driven migration prediction systems, the following areas warrant exploration:

1. **Global Adaptability**: Expanding the model to address migration across multiple regions with diverse environmental, social, and economic contexts.
2. **Multi-Causal Analysis**: Incorporating triggers such as conflicts, pandemics, and economic crises for a comprehensive understanding of migration dynamics.
3. **Temporal Scaling**: Including long-term climate data to analyze sustained climate impacts on migration patterns.
4. **Enhanced Indicators**: Adding variables like trade metrics, inflation indices, and political stability indicators to improve predictive depth.

### **Final Takeaway**

This study underscores the critical need for **proactive migration management** in the face of climate change. By integrating predictive AI models with robust reporting mechanisms, it provides governments, NGOs, and humanitarian organizations with the tools necessary to transition from reactive responses to **anticipatory planning**. The proposed framework not only enhances the efficiency of resource allocation but also promotes sustainable resettlement practices, reducing the socioeconomic burdens of displacement.

As climate-induced migration continues to challenge global resilience, systems like DIPS will play an increasingly pivotal role in shaping informed, equitable, and sustainable solutions for affected populations. This research lays the foundation for a future where data-driven insights guide humanitarian efforts, fostering stability and resilience in vulnerable communities worldwide.
